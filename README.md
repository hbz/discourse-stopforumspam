# discourse-stopforumspam

The Stop Forum Spam plugin can help weed out human spammers who are able to bypass Discourseâ€™s built-in spam tools (thanks to their awesome human powers). Right after a new user signs up on your 
forum (before they have time to post), this plugin will check the user's email address, forum username, and/or IP address (depending on your plugin settings) against 
the [Stop Forum Spam](https://www.stopforumspam.com) database. If the user is found in this database of known spammers, their user account will be immediately auto silenced in Discourse.

**Note:** If needed, you can unsilence the user in the **Users** &rarr; **Silenced** section of the Discourse Admin.

## Configuration

After installing this plugin in Discourse, you'll be able to configure the following settings in the **Settings** &rarr; **Plugins** section of the Discourse Admin:

- **stopforumspam check email:** Silence new user if email is found in Stop Forum Spam database.

- **stopforumspam check username:** Silence new user if username is found in Stop Forum Spam database. 

- **stopforumspam check ip:** Silence new user if IP is found in Stop Forum Spam database.

- **stopforumspam recheck users after hours:** Number of hours to wait before rechecking new users a second time to make sure they are still not in the Stop Forum Spam database. Set to 0 to disable recheck.

**Note:** If you have more than one of these check settings enabled, the user will be deemed a spammer as soon as one of them is found in the Stop Forum Spam database.
